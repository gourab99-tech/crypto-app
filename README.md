# About the project build
This project is made using `ReactJS` and the api used is fetched using `RapidAPI`. The project consists of components which gets rendered when called from the `Navbar` whihc consists of all the routes avilable. To build this `Coin Market API` was used to get the details about each crypto coin.\
To get the news we used the `Bing News API` to get all the latest news about crypto coins.\
To fetch the API we made the `services` folder to make the files `CryptoApi.js` and `CryptoNewsApi.js`. Through this we fetched the API and the results were exported to the `app` folder where we stored the `store.js`, all the fetched results were stores in this file. Then the neccesary details were routed to their respective pages.\
For the designing purpose `Antd` was used to get the card and other type structure to store the crypto coin details. Then we used `millify` to simplify the use of different components and to make the designing more efficient.\
To make the route between different routes `axios` is used. It makes the routes more efficient.
